# NameplateBoom
This is a super duper WIP addon for adding some oomph to nameplates. 

The original idea behind this
is to allow a user to disable scrolling combat text (which often clutters the screen 
quite a bit) in favor of more subtle nameplate "effects" while retaining some of the
fun/satisfaction of having combat numbers pop up as you deal damage. 

Interestingly enough, I'm using Nameplate Scrolling Combat Text (NSCT) as inspiration
(while also borrowing more than a bit of its code).

The NSCT addon can be found here: https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/269544-nameplate-scrolling-combat-text
